# top3
Here's what LinkedIn recommendations say about me.

## Quick Start
  $ python3 -m venv </path/to/new/virtual/environment>
  $ source </path/to/new/virtual/environment>/bin/activate
  $ pip3 install -k requirements.txt
  $ ./top3.py
  
If you see requests to download nltk data, follow the instuctions and then run top3.py again.
